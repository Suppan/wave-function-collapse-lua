# wave-function-collapse-lua
simple algorithm to create complex structures with simple rules (which neighbours are allowed)

## Usage

after installing Lua (ie via homebrew: brew install lua)
and imagemagick (ie via homebrew: brew install imagemagick)

enter in terminal: 
```
lua main.lua
```
result: "demo.png" (dim=10x10)
<div align="left"><img src="/resources/demo.png" width="300px"</img></div> 

You can set/alter the dimension (size) and the outputname in the file "main.lua) 

build of these 5 tiles (/tileSet):

![](tileSet/blank.png) = 1 
![](tileSet/up.png) = 2
![](tileSet/right.png) = 3
![](tileSet/down.png) = 4
![](tileSet/left.png) = 5
